How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

It reduced the number of lines I had to look at. It gave me an orientation in time to diagnose.


What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does

Pros
logical save point
variable intervals for distinct projects

Cons
Disruption leads to lost work
non standard between users

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

You have an un-do button. You can even (I think) take a project multiple directions 

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

Well, I almost have my workspace set up. I am still unsure how to launch the editor as a command, but hopefully that's coming up. I want to use Git to work on my game. Although I am increasingly doubtful about the premise.
